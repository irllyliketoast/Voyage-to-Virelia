# Voyage to Virelia üååü™ê  
A Sci-Fi Web Experience in Responsive Design

## Project Overview  
This mini-project is part of my Management Information Systems (UNCW MIS 310) class. The objective was to create a responsive webpage using **CSS variables** and **CSS grid**. I chose to build a fictional space exploration site for the planet **Virelia**, blending creative storytelling with technical implementation. This project refines my skills in CSS layout design, accessibility, and user interactivity through a sci-fi lens.

## Features  

### Responsive Design  
The layout dynamically adapts across four screen widths using CSS Grid and media queries. It maintains a seamless experience from large desktops to mobile phones.

### Interactive Planetary Cards  
Each planetary feature (e.g., gravity, climate, biosphere) is displayed as a card. Clicking or pressing `Enter`/`Space` on a card opens a modal popup with more detailed information.

### Theme Toggle (Day/Night Mode)  
A toggle switch in the header allows users to shift between atmospheric "day" and "night" views by switching CSS variable themes.

### Animated Entry Sequence  
A separate loading page features a glitching text animation and animated planet entrance. Clicking the planet triggers a fade-out transition and redirects to the main experience.

### Accessibility Features  
- **ARIA labels** for assistive technology
- **Keyboard navigation** (`tabindex`, `role="button"`, `Enter`/`Space` listeners)
- **Alt text** on all images
- **Semantic HTML** elements (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<dialog>`)

## Technology Used  

- **HTML**: Semantic structure for content, navigation, and modal elements  
- **CSS**:  
  - CSS Variables (`:root`) for consistent design values  
  - CSS Grid and media queries for responsive layout  
  - Keyframe animations and hover transitions  
- **JavaScript**:  
  - Modal logic and keyboard event handling  
  - Dynamic glitch-text loader  
  - Theme toggle interactivity

## Purpose  
This site imagines an alien planet named **Virelia**, home to shimmering crystals, solar storms, and hovercraft terrain. The goals of this project were to:

- Practice CSS Grid and variable usage for layout and styling
- Create a **responsive** and **accessible** design
- Explore interactive UI components through modals and theme switching
- Present a creative narrative using **original design and code**
